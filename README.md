# Go Home Team
---

## Overview

Go Home Team is a simple, interactive tool designed to help you determine your departure time based on your arrival and break schedule, then automatically add an "out for the day" event to your Google Calendar. This project aims to streamline the process of tracking your work hours and ensuring accurate calendar entries.

## Features (Planned)

* **Interactive Time Selector:** Easily input your arrival time using a user-friendly interface.
* **Break Selector:** Choose between a 30-minute or 1-hour break (or potentially custom break durations in the future).
* **Calculated Departure Time:** Automatically determine your recommended departure time based on a standard workday (e.g., 8 hours plus your selected break).
* **Google Calendar Integration:** Seamlessly add an "Out for the day" event to your specified Google Calendar with the calculated departure time.

## Getting Started (for local development/testing)

This project is currently in its early stages. Once a basic version is available, detailed instructions for setting up and running the application locally will be provided here. This will likely involve:

1.  **Cloning the repository:** `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  **Installing dependencies:** (e.g., `npm install` for a web-based frontend, `pip install -r requirements.txt` for a Python backend)
3.  **Configuring Google Calendar API access:** Instructions on how to set up credentials for your Google account to allow the application to access your calendar.
4.  **Running the application:** (e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`)

## Development Status

This project is currently a foundational idea. The initial focus will be on building the core logic for time calculation and setting up the basic interactive selectors. Google Calendar integration will be a subsequent step, initially tested with a personal Gmail account.
